# matplotlib-challenge
Materials for the Matplotlib Module 5 challenge for the BCS Data Analytics boot camp

All code is mine. I got help from Xpert Learning Assistant and internet searches to understand concepts and to see examples of code that performs similar actions. I got assists in particular from the Pandas documentation and StackOverflow. I had a tutoring session that was particularly helpful in helping me crack the Outliers and Boxplots section.

The Jupyter Notebook file contains all of the results and some analysis.
